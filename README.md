# Sleepy Bot ðŸŒ™
`@armeetjatyani` `2019` `Heroku` `JavaScript` `Discord.js` `mongo-db`

## Intro
- I learned how to use NPM and discord.js (https://discord.js.org/#/) to create a Discord Bot
- the bot's purpose was to track sleep hours of members of a discord server
- friends could compete to see who could get more (or less) sleep!

## Demo
`Coming soon...`

## Run
To run this discord bot, clone this repo, and setup Heroku.
